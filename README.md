# double

This game is based on a popular web based game called 2048.

Features:

1. 2 is twice as likely to appear as 4. 4 is twice as likely to appear as 8. 8 is twices as likely to appear as 16. Etc.
2. If you place a number next to the same number, it will double. If the double is next to another number, it will double as well.
3. If you reach 128, a 3x3 section of the board will clear.

If you are wondering why it's 128 and not 2048, it's because when I made the numbers appear correctly (2 appears twice as much as 4), it became much harder to win.
Also, there are no points for clearing out multiple numbers at the same time.
